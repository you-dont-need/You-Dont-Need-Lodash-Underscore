*:heavy_exclamation_mark:<b>Important:</b> Note that most native equivalents are array methods,
and will not work with objects. If this functionality is needed and no object method is provided,
then Lodash/Underscore might be the better option. Bear in mind however, that all iterable
objects can easily be converted to an array by use of the
[spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).*
