### _.isNaN

Checks if a value is NaN.

  ```js
  // Underscore/Lodash
  console.log(_.isNaN(NaN))
  // output: true

  // Native
  console.log(isNaN(NaN))
  // output: true

  // ES6
  console.log(Number.isNaN(NaN))
  // output: true
  ```
MDN:
>In comparison to the global `isNaN()` function, `Number.isNaN()` doesn't suffer the problem of forcefully converting the parameter to a number. This means it is now safe to pass values that would normally convert to `NaN`, but aren't actually the same value as `NaN`. This also means that only values of the type number, that are also `NaN`, return true. [Number.isNaN()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN)

Voice from the Lodash author:

>Lodash's `_.isNaN` is equiv to ES6 `Number.isNaN` which is different than the global `isNaN`.
